# CandyShop

<h2> Shopping App. </h2>
<h4> Developer: Batya Pollack </h4>

Explanation: I have developed a website of a candy store where it is possible to add items to the shopping cart and pay.
Payment is made via a PayPal account or by credit card.

- The shopping cart is saved in localStorage.
- You can add to the shopping cart some sweets of the same type.
- You can search for a particular candy from the candy list.
- Sweets can be deleted from shopping cart.
